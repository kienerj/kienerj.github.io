title: About me
subtitle: Jack of all trades

My name is Joos Kiener and I work in chemical research doing various IT and data science 
related tasks from system administration to database design and web application 
development and machine learning. I'm very pragmatic, application-oriented and a quick
learner. Need a vision and/or a prototype? You have come to the right place.

I have been part of integrating SAP ordering system with a chemical inventory system,
implemented and wrote the guide for corporate IT how to connect Apache webserver to the 
SSO (Single sign-on) solution and created state-of-the-art models for certain physchem
properties highly relevant in the industry. The models are deployed with KNIME server.

OK, I stop here with the self-marketing. I'm actually a pretty reasonable and modest guy.
