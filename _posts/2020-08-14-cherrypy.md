[CherryPy](https://cherrypy.org/) is a minimalist python web framework. You may ask what "minimalist" means in the context of web frameworks? It does not offer any front-end tools and does not offer any ORM. But you can use one of your choice if you whish to do so. It's unopinionated. You can access your data directly with the according database-specific library (cx_Oracle, psycopg2,...) or combine it with SQLAlchemy. It's up to you. I really prefer it for creating simple web services that can be used over multiple applications. In this blog post I will outline how to setup CherryPy on an Ubuntu server.

## Installing CherryPy

CherryPy is available via pip or conda. Back when I started using it, the build on conda was outdated. Right now it's up to date but looking at the history I'm not sure the official maintainers regularly update the conda builds. Since this is a pure python module I suggest to stick with the official guide and install CherryPy via pip. We will use a conda environment so you will need to have anaconda or miniconda already installed.

```bash
conda create -n webservices python=3.7
conda activate webservices
pip install cherrypy
```

We will use python 3.7 because RDKit as of now does not have an official 3.8 build available on conda. And yes, if you haven't figured it out yet, we will use CherryPy to create a webservice that uses RDKit functionality.
