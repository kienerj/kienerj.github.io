Dear reader, welcome to my blog. My name is Joos Kiener. I have a background in biology. After my
masters I transitioned into the area of research IT. I have experience with research informatics
systems, database design, web application development and data science topics like ETL, data
analysis and machine learning. While gathering this experience and knowledge I also completed a MAS
(Master of Advanced Studies) in Computer Science and a DAS (Diploma of Advanced Studies) in Data
Science. In this context "Advanced Studies" means that you can only enter the course if you have a
prior degree in a relevant field and that you are expected to know the basics already like algebra
for computer science or programming/python for data science.

In summary I'm a Jack of all trades having relevant skills in many areas and being able to bring
them together in a useful, practical and efficient way. But don't expect me to explain you the inner
workings of ResNet or design a new neural network architecture from scratch. 

## Blog content

I expect to post helpful tricks and methods around working with chemical and biological information
using KNIME, python and RDKit. There certainly will also be less or non-technical background post
and posts about recent publications I found interesting. Albeit given the current state of
publishing it will be much more likely I will rant about yet another not very convincing application
of ML or "AI" in the general field of chemical research. I do seem agree with [Pat Walters](https://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/) [posts](https://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/2020/05/some-thoughts-on-comparing.html)
about the state of publishing in regards to ML and "AI".

I imagine I will also post about some small tricks and tips that only take a couple of sentences to
write as I'm thinking of such a topic right now. I can also see some posts being really more in the
software engineering area than data science. 

## Disclaimer: About statistics

I'm not very well versed in statistical methods besides the basics. I admit it. So if you recognize
any issues or errors in future post regarding this, don't hesitate to comment and explain the found
issue. I'm for sure an "applied data scientist" and actually more leaning towards data engineering.

Also looking forward to have interesting exchanges also in the comments with future readers. But to
be realistic I don't expect \(m\)any anytime soon. Part of the goal of this blog is also to showcase my
portfolio/skills as a social media presence in the Tech/IT fields nowadays seems to required.
