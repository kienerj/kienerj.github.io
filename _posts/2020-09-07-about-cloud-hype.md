I admittedly spend too much time on tech forums and doing so I have observed
everyone and their dog wanting to deploy their "stuff" on the cloud. 

> Hi there, I created this new awesome AI model with <insert cool new hyped tech>. How can I deploy it to the cloud?

If you don't already know how to, you probably should not because you lack the reason to do so. 

## It's about cost

I think the core issue here is that the general believe is that the cloud is cheap and local hardware is expensive. This simply isn't true for almost all use-cases and especially not compute-heavy workloads for which the cloud is extremely expensive and often doesn't actually offer an ideal configuration for your needs. 

#### Is hardware actually expensive?

Just go to a local shops website and configure a powerful system. I tried several. You can get a a 32-core machine with a powerful GPU (RTX 2080 Super), 128 GB of RAM and lots of SSD storage for less than $7k. For 10k you get 64-cores, 256 GB RAM and a RTX 2080 TI. You can adjust the cores, RAM and GPU power according to your needs but the point is one can get a huge amount of compute power for 10k or less. More than you will actually will be able to easily use without the right software (multi-threaded).
